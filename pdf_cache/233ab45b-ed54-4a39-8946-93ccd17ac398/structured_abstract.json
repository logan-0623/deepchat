{"abstract": "**Abstract**  \n• We demonstrate the failure of numerical methods including Monte Carlo simulation for predicting statistical behavior of simple nonlinear dynamical systems  \n• Focusing on quadratic logistic maps $f_a(x) = ax(1-x)$, we prove the existence of computable parameters with non-computable SRB (Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measures  \n• This establishes a fundamental limitation in algorithmic approaches to statistical dynamics  \n\n**Introduction**  \n• Nonlinear dynamical systems often exhibit chaotic behavior that defies deterministic prediction  \n• Monte Carlo methods have been the standard computational tool for statistical analysis since Ulam's 1946 proposal  \n• We identify a paradox where computable systems possess physically meaningful but algorithmically inaccessible statistical limits  \n\n**Related Work**  \n• Prior studies established computability of attractors in quadratic maps [RY19]  \n• Non-computable invariant measures were constructed for circle maps [GHR10]  \n• Our work bridges these directions by addressing SRB measures in unimodal systems  \n• Contrasts with [BBRY11] showing computability of Brolin-Lyubich measures  \n\n**Methodology**  \n• Employ constructive methods from [HK90] to build parabolic parameters $a \\in (0,4)$  \n• Utilize Wasserstein-Kantorovich distance $W_1$ to quantify measure convergence  \n• Design an algorithmic procedure switching weights between periodic orbits $Per_a(n)$  \n• Incorporate Turing machine halting states into measure construction  \n\n**Experiment**  \n• Construct nested intervals $I_k$ converging to computable $a_\\infty$  \n• Verify $|\\nu_{m_k}^r(x)(Per_r(n)) - l_n^k| < 2^{-k}$ on sets of measure $1-2^{-k}$  \n• Show physical measure $\\mu_a$ encodes the Halting Problem via periodic orbit weights  \n• Prove non-computability through reduction to measure approximation  \n\n**Conclusion**  \n• Provides first explicit examples where Monte Carlo methods provably fail  \n• Reveals unexpected complexity in elementary 1D systems  \n• Opens questions about prevalence in higher-dimensional systems  \n• Challenges foundational assumptions in computational dynamics"}
