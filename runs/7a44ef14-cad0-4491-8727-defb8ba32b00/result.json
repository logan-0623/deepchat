{"status": "success", "reply": "**Answer:**\n\n1. **Linear Regression (MSE):** Model 2 is better with an MSE of approximately 3,011.98 compared to Model 1's 128,538.17.  \n   - **Reason:** Model 2's predictions are closer to the actual labels, resulting in a much lower MSE.\n\n2. **Linear Classification (0-1 Loss):** Both models perform equally with a 0-1 loss of 0.5 (2 errors out of 4).  \n   - **Reason:** Each model misclassifies two instances, leading to identical 0-1 loss values.\n\n3. **Logistic Regression (Log Loss):** Both models have the same log loss.  \n   - **Reason:** Extreme predictions (saturated sigmoid outputs) for misclassified instances result in identical log loss values (~69.08) despite opposite errors.\n\n4. **Prediction for New Input (181,92,12.4):** The first model predicts **class 1**.  \n   - **Calculation:**  \n     \\( f_w(x) = 2(181) + 92 + 20(12.4) - 330 = 372 \\).  \n     \\( \\sigma(372) \\approx 1 \\), so \\( P(y=1|x) \\approx 1 \\), predicting class 1.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n- Model 2 excels in regression (lower MSE).  \n- Both models tie in classification (0-1 loss and log loss).  \n- New input is classified as 1 by Model 1.", "task_id": "7a44ef14-cad0-4491-8727-defb8ba32b00"}
