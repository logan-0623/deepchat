**Abstract**  
• PG-SAM integrates medical LLMs (Large Language Models) to enhance multi-organ segmentation accuracy  
• Proposed fine-grained modality prior aligner bridges domain gaps between text and medical images  
• Multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer improve boundary precision  
• Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Synapse dataset with $84.79\%$ mDice  

**Introduction**  
• Segment Anything Model (SAM) underperforms in medical imaging due to domain gaps  
• Existing methods suffer from coarse text priors and misaligned modality fusion  
• PG-SAM introduces medical LLMs for fine-grained anatomical text prompts  
• Key innovation: Joint optimization of semantic alignment and pixel-level details  

**Related Work**  
• Prompt-free SAM variants (e.g., SAMed, H-SAM) lack domain-specific priors  
• CLIP-based alignment methods (e.g., TP-DRSeg) face granularity limitations  
• Medical LLMs show potential but require integration with visual features  
• PG-SAM uniquely combines LoRA-tuned CLIP with hierarchical feature fusion  

**Methodology**  
• Fine-grained modality prior aligner generates Semantic Guide Matrix $G \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L \times L}$  
• Multi-level feature fusion uses deformable convolution for edge preservation:  
  $$F_{\text{fusion}} = \phi(F_{\text{up}}^{(2)}) + \psi(\text{Align}(G; \theta))$$  
• Iterative mask optimizer employs hypernetwork for dynamic kernel generation:  
  $$\Omega_i = \text{MLP}(m_i) \odot W_{\text{base}}$$  

**Experiment**  
• Synapse dataset: 3,779 CT slices with 8 abdominal organs  
• Achieves $84.79\%$ mDice (fully supervised) and $75.75\%$ (10% data)  
• Reduces HD95 to $7.61$ (↓$5.68$ vs. H-SAM) for boundary precision  
• Ablation shows $+4.69\%$ mDice gain from iterative mask optimization  

**Conclusion**  
• PG-SAM outperforms SOTA by integrating medical LLMs with SAM  
• Fine-grained priors and multi-level fusion address modality misalignment  
• Future work: Extend to 3D segmentation and real-time clinical applications
